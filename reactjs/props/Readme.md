# props

- props allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component.
- Example: Imagine a blog application where you have a Post component. You pass the post details (title, author, content) as props to the Post component from a parent component.
    
        const ProductComponent = (props) => {
        return (
            <div>
            <h2>{props.product.name}</h2>
            <p>{props.product.description}</p>
            </div>
        );
        };
