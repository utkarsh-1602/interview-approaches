# WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

### Q1
From your `CUSTOMERS` table, return all the records of the customers who are from "Mexico"
```sql 
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE Country = 'Mexico';
```


>### Note: SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes). However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes.
