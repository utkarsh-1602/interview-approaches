# Fetch API 

Fetch API is a modern interface that provides a powerful and flexible feature to fetch resources asynchronously over the network, like XMLHttpRequest, but with a more powerful and flexible feature set.

## How does Fetch handle JSON responses?
The Fetch API provides the `.json()` method on the Response object to handle JSON responses. This method returns a Promise that resolves to the JSON object once it is parsed.
