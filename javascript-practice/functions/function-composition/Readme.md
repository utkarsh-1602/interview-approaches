# Function Composition in JavaScript
In functional programming, function composition is a powerful technique that allows developers to combine multiple functions into a single function. This compositional approach promotes code reuse, modularity, and readability.

- **Function composition** is the process of chaining together multiple functions to form a new function. It involves applying a series of transformations or operations to an input value, where the output of one function becomes the input of the next function in the composition chain.

- The **compose** function takes in two or more functions and returns a new function that applies these functions in right-to-left order. This means that the rightmost function is applied first, followed by the next function to its left, and so on.

- compose is a higher order function
