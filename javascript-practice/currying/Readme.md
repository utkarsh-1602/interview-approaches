# Currying in JavaScript
- Currying is a functional programming technique in JavaScript where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of nested functions, each taking a single argument. This allows you to partially apply arguments to a function, creating new functions with fewer arguments.

## Partial Application 
- Partial application is the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing a new function with the remaining arguments.
- Partial application allows you to create a specialized version of a function by providing a subset of its arguments, while leaving the rest of the arguments to be supplied later.
