# promise vs async await

1. Syntax: The promise involves chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` methods, whereas Async Await uses a try-catch block that looks more like synchronous code. async/await‚Äù provides a more linear and structured flow.

2. Error Handling: With Promises, errors are handled using .catch() or chaining multiple .then() blocks. async/await allows error handling using try/catch blocks, which can be more intuitive and resemble synchronous error handling.

3. Readability: async/await often results in cleaner and more readable code, especially for complex asynchronous flows, by resembling synchronous code structure.
