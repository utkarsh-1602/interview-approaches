# Event delegation 

Event delegation is a JavaScript technique where you attach an event listener to a parent element rather than to its individual child elements. This allows you to handle events for multiple child elements using a single event listener. When an event occurs, it bubbles up from the child elements to the parent element, and you can then determine which child element triggered the event.
