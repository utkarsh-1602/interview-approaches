# `arguments`

- In JavaScript, the `arguments` object is a local variable available inside all functions that represent the arguments passed to the function. 
- It is an **array-like object**, but not a **true array**, which means it doesn't have array methods like `map`, `forEach`, etc., but it does have a length property and can be indexed like an array.
