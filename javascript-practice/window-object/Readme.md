# Window Object 

- In JavaScript, the window object represents the browser window or frame that contains the JavaScript code. It is the global object in client-side JavaScript environments, such as web browsers.
- The window object provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window, including manipulating the browser's location, controlling the browser history, interacting with other frames or windows, setting timeouts and intervals for executing code, and more.
- In JavaScript, when you declare a variable globally using `var`, it becomes a property of the global object (window in browsers)
