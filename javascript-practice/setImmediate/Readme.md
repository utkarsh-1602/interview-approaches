# `setImmediate()`

`setImmediate()` is a Node.js-specific function that executes a callback function asynchronously as soon as possible, after the current event loop iteration. It's similar to setTimeout() with a delay of 0 milliseconds, but setImmediate() has a higher priority and is executed after I/O events but before setTimeout().
