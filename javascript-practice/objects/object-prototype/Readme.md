# Javascript Object Prototypes 

- In JavaScript, every object has a property called prototype. It's a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from another object, often referred to as their prototype. The prototype property is used to add properties and methods to an object's prototype.
- When you define a constructor function, JavaScript automatically creates a prototype object for that constructor. Any instances created using that constructor inherit properties and methods from this prototype.
