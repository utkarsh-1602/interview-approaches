# Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms

-  Polymorphism allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations

- In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. This is called polymorphism.

**Polymorphism with Functions and Objects**: It is also possible in JavaScript that we can make functions and objects with polymorphism.
