# Object 

- An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods. For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, type, model, and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving. The characteristics of an Object are called Properties in Object-Oriented Programming and the actions are called methods.

- An Object is an instance of a class. Objects are everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object whether it is a function, array, or string. 

- The object can be created in two ways in JavaScript:
    - Object Literal
    - Object Constructor
