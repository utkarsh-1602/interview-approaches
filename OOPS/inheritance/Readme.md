# Inheritance 
- Inheritance is a concept by which one class is allowed to inherit the fields and methods of another class. 
- It means that we can create new classes based on the existing ones. 
- A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. 
- In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.
