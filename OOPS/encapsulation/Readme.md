# Encapsulation 

- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world. Encapsulation helps in maintaining the integrity of data and ensures that it is not accessed or modified inappropriately. 

## Encapsulation in JavaScript: 
In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved using two techniques: using **closures** and using **classes**. 

- **Using Closures**: In JavaScript, closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer lexical environment, even after the outer function has returned. Private variables and methods can be created using closures.

- **Using Classes**: ES6 introduced the class syntax in JavaScript, which allows us to define classes and objects in a more structured way. Classes can be used to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript.
