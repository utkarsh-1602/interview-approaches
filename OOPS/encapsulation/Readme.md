# Encapsulation 

- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information to the outside world.
- Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object.

## Encapsulation in JavaScript: 
In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved using two techniques: using **closures** and using **classes**. 

- **Using Closures**: In JavaScript, closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer lexical environment, even after the outer function has returned. Private variables and methods can be created using closures.

- **Using Classes**: ES6 introduced the class syntax in JavaScript, which allows us to define classes and objects in a more structured way. Classes can be used to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript.
