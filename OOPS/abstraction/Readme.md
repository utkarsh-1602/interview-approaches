# Abstraction 
-  Abstraction Focuses on hiding the unnecessary complexity of an object or system.
- Presents a simplified view, exposing only the essential features and functionalities that a user needs to interact with

## Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation

| Feature           | Encapsulation                                      | Abstraction                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Definition        | Bundling data and methods into a single unit      | Hiding unnecessary details, presenting essentials|
| Purpose           | Hide internal state, expose necessary functionalities | Simplify complex systems, ease interaction |
| Implementation    | Access modifiers (public, private, protected)     | Interfaces, abstract classes, clear boundaries |
| Example           | Class `Car` encapsulates properties and methods  | Car dashboard abstracts internal car workings |
| Focus             | Bundling data and methods, controlling access     | Simplifying complexity, presenting clear view |
| What is Hidden    | Internal state of object                           | Implementation details                        |
| Level of Detail   | Internal class structure                          | Overall system design and interaction        |
