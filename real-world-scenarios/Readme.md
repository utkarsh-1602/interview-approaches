# Using Async Await Function 
I'm building a social media platform.
Let's say, for example, you have a feature that allows users to post updates and also retrieve a list of their friends' recent posts to display on their timeline. In this scenario:

- When a user posts an update, you might need to perform asynchronous operations like uploading media files, updating the user's post data in the database, and notifying their friends about the new post.
- To display the user's timeline, you need to fetch recent posts from all their friends. This involves making asynchronous requests to the server to retrieve the data.

The async functions would handle the asynchronous operations, ensuring that each step waits for the previous one to complete before moving on.


# Using Callback Function 
Imagine you are developing a chat application. In this application, users can send messages to each other in real-time. Here's how a callback function could be conceptually applied:

Real-Time Messaging (Asynchronous Operation): Sending and receiving messages in real-time involves asynchronous operations. When a user sends a message, it needs to be delivered to the server and then broadcasted to the recipient(s). Similarly, when a user receives a message, it's an asynchronous event triggered by the server.

Callback Function: To handle the real-time messages effectively, you might use callback functions. For instance, when a new message is received from the server, you could have a callback function that updates the chat interface to display the new message. This way, the callback function is executed in response to the asynchronous event (message received), allowing you to update the UI dynamically.

User Authentication (Asynchronous Operation): Another scenario could involve user authentication. When a user tries to log in, the server checks the credentials asynchronously. A callback function could be employed here to handle the result of the authentication process. If the authentication is successful, the callback function might redirect the user to their dashboard; otherwise, it could display an error message.
