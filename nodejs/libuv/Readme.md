## what is libuv ? 
- Libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for asynchronous I/O based on event loops. It was initially developed for Node.js to handle the event-driven architecture, but it has since been adopted by other projects due to its performance and efficiency. 

## Libuv's primary features include:
- Event loop
- Asynchronous file and file system operations
- Asynchronous TCP and UDP sockets
- Child processes
- Thread pool
-Timers, signals, and polls

By handling all these features, libuv enables Node.js to work as a single-threaded, non-blocking, and event-driven platform.
