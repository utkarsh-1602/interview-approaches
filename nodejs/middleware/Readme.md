# What is a Middleware ?
- Middleware is the function that works between the request and the response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller sends the response.
- Middleware functions can execute any code, modify request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.
- In Node.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. 

Middleware functions are typically used to perform tasks such as:

1. Parsing incoming request data: Middleware can parse data from the request body, query parameters, headers, or cookies and make it available to subsequent handlers.
2. Authentication and authorization: Middleware can check if a user is authenticated and authorized to access certain routes or resources.
3. Error handling: Middleware can catch errors that occur during the handling of a request and respond with an appropriate error message or status code.
4. Logging: Middleware can log information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL, and timestamp.
5. Compression: Middleware can compress response data to reduce bandwidth usage and improve page load times.
6. Caching: Middleware can cache responses to reduce the need to regenerate them for subsequent requests.
7. Middleware functions are added to the Express.js application using the app.use() method and are executed in the order they are added to the application's middleware stack
