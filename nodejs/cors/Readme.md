# CORS 
- CORS Stands for **Cross origin Resource Sharing**
- CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different origin.
- An origin is defined by the combination of the **protocol** (such as HTTP or HTTPS), **domain**, and **port number**.
- CORS allows servers to specify who can access their resources and under what conditions.
- When a web page hosted on one origin (e.g., domain) makes a request to a different origin, the browser typically blocks the request for security reasons.
- However, CORS allows servers to include special headers in their responses that indicate whether or not the request is allowed from a particular origin. If the server permits the request, the browser allows the response to be accessed by the requesting page.
