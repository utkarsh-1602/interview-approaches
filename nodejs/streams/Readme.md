# Streams in Nodejs 
In Node.js, streams are a fundamental concept used to handle data flow. They are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination continuously. Streams are particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data, as they allow you to process data in small, manageable chunks rather than loading everything into memory at once.
