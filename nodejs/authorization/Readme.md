# Authorization in Nodejs

In Node.js, authorization typically refers to the process of determining whether a user or a system entity has the necessary permissions to access certain resources or perform specific actions within an application. This can include actions such as accessing certain routes, reading or modifying data in a database, or performing other operations.
