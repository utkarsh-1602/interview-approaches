# Connecting MongoDB to Nodejs 

## What is difference between MongoDB Schema and Model ?
- In MongoDB, a schema defines the structure of the documents stored in a collection.
- In the context of using MongoDB with Node.js (typically with libraries like Mongoose), a model represents a specific collection in the MongoDB database and provides an interface for interacting with that collection.
