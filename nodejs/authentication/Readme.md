# Authentication in Nodejs

There are two Authentication Patterns in Node.js: 
1. Stateful : which maintains state or data or server side 
2. Stateless : which has no state 


## Stateful Authentication
- In stateful authentication, the server creates a session for the user after successful login and stores session information on the server-side.
- for example, if you are registering, then you will send username and password to the server, then server will create a new **uid**(unique identification number) and it will store this uid on server-side, and will send that uid to client side for logging in future.

But how to transfer the uid ? 
here's how you can do.....

## How to Transfer the UID
There are multiple ways to transfer uid :

## Stateless Authentication
- In stateless authentication, the server doesnâ€™t store any session information about the user. Instead, each request that the user makes to the server contains all the necessary information for authentication, typically in the form of a JWT. The server then validates the token and responds accordingly.
- Stateless authentication is popular in modern web applications because it is scalable and can be used with the microservices architecture.
