# What is a web socket ? 

- WebSockets are specifically designed to enable realtime bidirectional communication between the server and client. This means the server can push realtime updates (like breaking news) as soon as they become available without waiting for the client to issue a request.

- A WebSocket in Node.js is a communication protocol that allows for real-time, full-duplex communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests where the client sends a request and the server responds, WebSocket allows both the client and the server to send data to each other at any time, creating a persistent connection.
