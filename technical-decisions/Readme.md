# Technical Decisions while Building a Project 

### What are the first 10 key technical decisions you would make if you wanted to create a chat app like WhatsApp or WeChat ? 

10 Key Technical Decisions I will take : 
1. Platform selection - Decide on the platforms the app will support (iOS, Android, Web). I will Choose whether to build a native app or use cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
2. Programming Language: Selecting a programming language, based on the platform selection
3. Backend Technology: Choosing a backend technology for server-side development. Popular choices include Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), Django (Python), Ruby on Rails, or Spring Boot (Java).
4. Database Selection: Decide on the type of database for storing user data and messages. Options include SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
5. Real-time Messaging Protocol: Implement a real-time messaging protocol to enable instant message delivery
6. Authentication and Authorization: Implement a secure user authentication system
7. Encryption and Security: Prioritize end-to-end encryption to ensure the security and privacy of user messages. 
8. Push Notifications:Integrate push notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, Apple Push Notification Service) to notify users of new messages and updates even when the app is not open.
9. Scalability and Load Balancing:Design the architecture with scalability in mind. Implement load balancing, consider microservices architecture, and use cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) to handle potential high traffic loads.
10. Cross-platform Communication:If building a multi-platform chat app like WeChat, consider the challenges of cross-platform communication.
